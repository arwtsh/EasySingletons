# Prototype Grid

This is a package for the Unity game engine. It makes creating non-monobehavior singletons much easier. It also allows code to be executed before Awake/Start methods and without any scripts in the scene.
Documentation on this project is stored in [`Documentation~/easysingletons.md`](https://github.com/arwtsh/PrototypeGrid/blob/main/Documentation~/prototypegrid.md)
